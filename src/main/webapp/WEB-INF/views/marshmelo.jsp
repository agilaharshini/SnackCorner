<h2>Instructions</h2><br>


<h3>line a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper or foil. Spray with cooking spray.
In a medium sauce pan, add the granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Clip on a candy thermometer, and turn the heat to medium-high. Bring the mixture to a boil without stirring, and continue to cook until it reaches 238-degrees Fahrenheit.
Meanwhile, add another 2 tablespoons of the water to a medium bowl, and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Let sit to dissolve for 5 minutes.
Next, in a small dish, add the last 2 tablespoons of water and microwave for 25 seconds, until hot. Remove from the microwave carefully, and then whisk in the cocoa powder.
Stir the cocoa powder and water mixture into the gelatin.
Once the hot sugar is at the proper temperature, begin to slowly stream it into the gelatin mixture while continuously beating with a hand mixer on medium-high. Be careful not to pour the hot molten sugar near the sides of the bowl because it will stick and harden immediately.
Beat the mixture for 10 minutes, until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla last.
Pour the mixture into the loaf pan, and let set for at least 3 hours.
To serve, lift the parchment paper or foil out of the pan, and cut the marshmallows into squares with a well-greased knife. Grease the knife between each cut. If the marshmallows are too sticky, roll them in extra cocoa powder.
If dunking in chocolate: place the marshmallows in the freezer for 5 minutes.
Combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium heat in 30 second pulses until melted, stirring between each pulse. Stir until chocolate is evenly melted and smooth.
Remove the marshmallows from the freezer, and dunk half of each marshmallow in the melted chocolate. Place each marshmallow back on the sheet, and refrigerate until the chocolate sets, about 5 minutes.</h3>
